DHCP

TCP/IP family
	UDP - User Datagram Protocol
		unreliable transfer.  Applications will need to implement their own reliability if necessary
		minimal overhead in both computation and communication
		best for LAN applications
		connectionless - no initial connection necessary.  No state in both ends
		
		Message Oriented
		Each message encapsulated in an IP datagram
	TCP - Transmission Control Protocol
		major transport protocol used in the internet
		reliable - uses acknowledgement and retransmission to accomplish reliability
		connection-oriented - initial connection is required.  both ends keep state about the connection
		full-duplex - communication can happen in both ways simultaneously
		stream interface - transfer of bytes look like writing/reading to a file

TCP Reliability

TCP Summary of Features
	1. Adaptive Retransmission
		restransmission timer is set to RTT+4*RTTVAR where RTT is estimated.  Allows TCP work in slow and fast networks
	2. Cumulative Acknowledgements
		Acknowledgment is for all bytes received so far without holes and not for every packet received
	3. Fast retransmission
		heuristic where a duplicated acknowledgment for the same sequence is signal of a packet lost.  Data is retransmitted before timer expires
	
	6. Reliable Connection and Shutdown
		TCP uses a three way handshake to open and close connections


When to use UDP or TCP
	reliable communication - tcp
	only use udp in following cases:
		broadcasting: computer needs to reach all or part of the computers in local network
			multicasting data to serveral machines simultaneously
		real time data: applications where packets arriving on time with minimum delay is more important than reliability where retransmission can add to the delay

NAT: Network Address Translation
	used when you want to connect multiple computers to internet using a single IP address
	NAT software can run on a computer or specialized device (NAT box) that has two network interfaces: one connected to the private network and the other one to the internet
	
	NAT box is also a DHCP server that assigns IP addresses and it is the default router
